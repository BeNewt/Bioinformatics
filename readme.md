Steps for a program that will loop through a string that represent DNA:
[x] assign a value to hello
[x] have a certain amount of A, C, G, T that will equal hello
[x] assign the value of 0 to tally_c
[x] assign the value of 0 to tally_g
[x] assign the value of 0 to tally_a
[x] assign the value of 0 to tally_t
[x] assign the value of 0 to count
[x] count how many 'C' are in hello
[x] for every 'C' add one to the tally_c
[x] count how many 'G' are in hello'
[x] for every 'G' add one to the tally_g
[x] count how many 'A' are in hello
[x] for every 'A'add one to the tally_a
[x] count how many 'T' are in hello
[x] for every 'T' add one to the tally_t
[x] add the tallies of 'C', 'G', 'A', 'T' to equal count
[x] print the total count
[x] print the total tallies of 'C', 'G', 'A', 'T'
